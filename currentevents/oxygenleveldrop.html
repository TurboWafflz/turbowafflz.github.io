            <h2><center>Waters along the West coast now have a hypoxia season</center></h2>
            <p>Waters on the West coast now have a hypoxia season. Hypoxia is when the water in the bottom of the ocean has oxygen levels so low that anything living there dies. It affects Oregon, Washington, and California in the summer and lasts anywhere from a few days to a few months, affecting from a square mile to a thousand square miles. This happens because the ocean is now warmer and thus holds less oxygen, and it also keeps the colder, deoxygenated water at the bottom of the ocean from being able to rise to the surface to collect oxygen. One obvious cause is climate change with the ocean absorbing most of the heat from the warming atmosphere. Warmer temperatures may also be slowing currents in the oceans. During the 20th century hypoxia was rarely seen, but it's been happening almost every year since 2002.</p>
