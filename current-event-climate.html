            <h2><center>Senior Director For Emerging Technologies Compares Carbon climate science to Nazi propoganda - Current Event</center></h2>
                <p>Recently appointed Senior Director For Emerging Technologies, William Happer, says that more carbon pollution “would be a benefit” to humanity in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled "In Defense of Carbon Dioxide." He told CNBC "The demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews." His only real qualification to be the Senior Director For Emerging Technologies, is serving as director of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Research under President George H. W. Bush, However that was 25 years ago, and isn't very relevant to emerging technologies. He says that "in an age of rising population and scarcities of food and water in some regions, it’s a wonder that humanitarians aren’t clamoring for more atmospheric carbon dioxide", while more CO&#8322; <i>can</i> cause plant growth, they would also need more water &amp; nutrients. But more food isn't really an improvement when your area is flooded, turned into a dust bowl, or too hot to live in. He seems to know about nothing except denying climate science which appears to be all that's required to join the Trump Team these days.</p>
