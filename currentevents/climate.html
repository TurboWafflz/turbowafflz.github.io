            <h2><center>New Federal Report Says Climate Change Is Already Hurting Communities In The US</center></h2>
                <p>A new federal report published by the US Global Change Research Program says that climate change is causing more severe weather more often in the US. This will cause damage to many things in the US unless we do something to stop global warming. The report goes into great detail about the ways climate change affects US communities. According to George Mason University professor Andrew Light "Climate change is already affecting every part of the United States, almost every sector of the United States, be it agriculture or forestry or energy, tourism," "It's going to hurt cities, it's going to hurt people in the countryside, and, as the world continues to warm, things are going to get worse." One example of these effects is the increase in the frequency of large wildfires. According to the report, climate change is "an immediate threat, not a far-off possibility."</p>
